# YOLO KAN : Explore KAN on CV tasks

This project mainly focuses on applying the [Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19756) to the Object Detection task. Specifically, we are solely experimenting with the YOLOv8 + KAN model on the COCO dataset

This project currently in testing phase, coarse code and hasn't guide, so stay stuned for instruction.

We are primilary using code base on these project :
